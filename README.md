# File-Transport,linux
Our team build a project about file transport between many clients.The project support p2p transmission and broadcast transmisssion,and every host has the authority to have a view of other hosts' information.
We has created a makefile,so you could use it to generate client.out and server.out.I am sorry to tell you that there are a few warnings if you use the "make" command,but it is not important to achieve the function.
